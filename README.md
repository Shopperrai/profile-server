## Introduction

Shopper.AI Backend APIs form the core of the Shopper.AI application, allowing users to interact with various features of the smart shopping assistant. This repository houses the Node.js server code that handles data processing, user authentication, and communication with the database.

## Local Setup

To set up the Shopper.AI Backend APIs locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/) and install it.

2. MongoDB: Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running locally or have access to a remote MongoDB server.
# Project Structure
The backend repository is organized as follows:
/ServerTask
  |-- /src                  # Source files for backend
  |     |-- /controllers    # Controllers handling request/response logic
  |     |-- /models         # Database models and schema definitions
  |     |-- /routes         # API routes and endpoint handlers
  |     |-- /services       # Business logic and services
  |     |-- app.js          # Main application file
  |     |-- server.js       # Server configuration and entry point
  |-- .env.example          # Example environment variables (Rename to .env)
  |-- package.json          # Node.js package file
  |-- README.md             # This file

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekCS3459/BackendApis.git
cd BackendApis
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure Environment Variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` template.
   - Update the environment variables in the `.env` file to match your MongoDB configuration and other settings.

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The Shopper.AI Backend APIs are now up and running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Using Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) provides a ready-to-code development environment with all the tools you need for seamless development. To start the project in Gitpod:

1. Click on the following link to open the workspace: [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/AbhishekCS3459/BackendApis)

2. This will launch a Gitpod workspace with the project already cloned and dependencies installed.

3. Configure Environment Variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` template.
   - Update the environment variables in the `.env` file to match your Gitpod MongoDB configuration and other settings.

4. The backend server will automatically start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
